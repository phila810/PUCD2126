            <h1>SNAKE PLANT</h1>
            <img src="snakeplantdecor.jpg" id="snakeplantdecor">
            <p class="info">What's great about this plant is that it emits oxygen at night time whilst simultaneously taking in carbon dioxide - something we naturally produce when breathing.  All this leads to a purer quality of air and a better night's sleep.</p>
            <h2>CARE</h2>

            <img src="sun.png" id="sun">
            <p id="sunp">When it comes to sunlight, the Snake Plant handles a variety of light situations extremely well. However, the more light, the faster it will grow!</p>


            <img src="water.png" id="water">
            <p id="waterp">Snake Plants are succulents, meaning the leaves retain lots of water, similar to a cactus. Not much water is needed at all, water every 2 to 3 weeks. In fact, what you should be cautious of is overwatering!</p>
