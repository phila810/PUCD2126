  <h1>CHAMOMILE</h1>

  <img src="chamomile.jpg" id="chamo">
  <p class="info"> Aside from Chamomile's physical appeal, some compounds in chamomile bind to the same brain receptors as drugs like Valium, calming them. In a 2009 clinical study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania concluded the first controlled clinical trial of chamomile extract for general anxiety disorder (GAD). The results suggest chamomile may benefit patients with mild to moderate GAD. Being an herb, many
  people use the leaves of Chamomile to put in their tea, also providing a calming sense.</p>

  <p id="sunp">Chamomile doesn't need too much sunlight, only about 4 hours of direct light per day. Place in a south facing windoe, and it should grow just dandy!</p>

  <p id="waterp">Watering is pretty simple for Chamomile. Water about once a week, it's a pretty forgiving plant, but try to keep a watering schedule. </p>
