      <h1>Garage Rock:</h1>
      <p2> Garage rock is a subgenre of rock'n'roll that dates back to the late 1950's
        when amateur bands exploded across the United States. The name comes from the
        assumption that bands practiced in suburban garages and were often very crude,
        but this belies the fact that they were diverse in their approaches, ranging
        from basic one or two chord wonders to very professional acts that even had
        regional hits.</p2>

    <p> It’s unfair to call the Kingsmen “one-hit-wonders,”
      as they did have hits besides “Louie, Louie” (even if
      they’re not well remembered today,) but very few bands
      in the history of rock & roll managed to get as much
      mileage from a single song as they did. Overlapping
      the rowdy beer-bust bellow of frat rock with the
      anyone-can-do-it sneer of garage rock, the Kingsmen
      were unapologetically a party band, and decades after
      the band was largely a memory, their version of “Louie, Louie”
      stubbornly refused to die, the enduring symbol of youthful
      good times and poor judgement set to music, as well as the
      most lyrically misinterpreted tune of its era.</p>
