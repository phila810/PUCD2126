  <h1>GERBERA DAISY</h1>

  <img src="gerberadaisy.jpg" id="gerbera">
  <p class="info">These bright and cheerful flowers couldn't help but put you in a good mood! With pink, orange, yellow and white, they should be a welcome addition to any room - and not just because they look good.
  They also release oxygen at night, which helps you breathe easy while you snooze. If you suffer from apnea or allergies, then these daisies are definitely recommended.</p>

  <p id="sunp">The Gerbera Daisy requires a lot of sunlight, but is picky about temperature. If placed in a window that has a lot of direct light throughout the day, it may be too hot and dry out the leaves. However, strong morning sunlight
  should work just fine. Without any sun at all, none of its flowers will bloom!</p>

  <p id="waterp">Water plant deeply whenever the top inch of the soil feels dry to the touch. Make sure to let the pot drain thoroughly before replacing it on the saucer or drip tray, as the plant is likely to rot in soggy soil.</p>
