  <p class="info">This plant has been known to improve symptoms of allergies including asthma. This also translates to better sleep for those with breathing problems. In as little as 12 hours, English Ivy cleans up to 94% of airborne feces and 78% of airborne mold!</p>

  <p id="sunp">English Ivy prefers a shady environment, seeing as it enjoys moisture. This makes for easy placement, just as long as it isn't placed anywhere with direct sunlight.</p>

  <p id="waterp">English Ivy only needs water when the top layer of soil is dried out. However, keeping your plant moist is a must. Do this by spraying your plant with water at least once or twice per week.</p>
