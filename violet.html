  <p class="info">African Violets are vibrant in color which is a health benefit in itself. Gazing at the plant can help to stimulate adrenaline release and can increase the flow of oxygen to the brain which can help you to relax.</p>

  <p id="sunp">African Violets need sunlight to survive, if they are placed in a shaded area they will starve. However, direct sunlight is not needed. A naturally bright lit room will do just fine.</p>

  <p id="waterp">The best advice for watering your violet is to base watering off of the top soil layer. If the top layer is completely dry, then it is time to water. Let the plant completely dry out before watering again.</p>
