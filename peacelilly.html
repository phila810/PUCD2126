  <h1>PEACE LILY</h1>
  <img src="peacelilly.jpg" id="peacelilly">
  <p class="info">The moisture given off by these striking flowers can boost a room's humidity by up to 5%. This suppresses airborne microbes which can lead to allergies, and also helps relieve those irritating dry noses and throats that keep you awake all night.</p>

  <h2>CARE</h2>
  <img src="sun.png" id="sun">
  <p id="sunp">Peace Lillies prefer to be in the shade rather than in sunlight. No direct sunlight, or even indirect sunlight is needed. The shadier the spot, the more flowers will grow!</p>
  <img src="water.png" id="water">
  <p id="waterp">One of the most common mistakes when caring for a Peace Lily is overwatering. Instead of watering on a schedule, check the top soil weekly. If completely dry,
    water. Some people even wait unti their plant starts to droop until watering, seeing as though the Peace Lily is extremely drought tolerant.
