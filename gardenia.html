  <p class="info">With glossy evergreen leaves and beautifully scented blossoms, Gardenias are a popular plant choice for bedrooms.

  <p id="sunp">Gardenias need a lot of sunlight, specifically direct sunlight for at least half of the day. However, Gardenias love humidity. This is a bit difficult to balance, but the easiest way to maintain humidity is to spray the plant once daily.</p>

  <p id="waterp">Due to the Gardenia's tricky humidity needs, moisture is a huge part in keeping your plant healthy. Water whenever the top layer of soil feels dry.</p>
